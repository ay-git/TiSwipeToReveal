TiSwipeToReveal
===============

Twitter like swipe to reveal implemented in Titanium.

The code is only a proof of concept, so it is very simple without following the "best practices" (commonJS modules, etc).
I did it this way so everybody can have a look at the code and maybe learn something instead of just using it as a copy/paste solution.

Anyway, I'm planing to make a CommonJS module later when I'll have more time and of course pull requests are welcomed.
